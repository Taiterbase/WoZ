This MMORPG framework was built using WoW's models and a C++, MySQL backend.
This project was pulled from BLC in 2012, and modified by me and a few other contributors
locally, not under GitHub.
The meat of my fun can be viewed here: \src\scripts\Custom (My knowledge of coding,
coding conventions, comments, and all of the sorts, was minimal as this was my
first exposure to programming), along with the Player.cpp file in src/game, 
and all of the sql queries in the sql folder.

Some of my initial grievances of learning a programming languages were familiarizing myself with the nuances of CMake, and the essence of debugging a failed build.  This project was birthed through strict motivation and naivety, along with countless acquaintances, friends, and companions.
